# What is Python?

Python is a **high-level, interpreted programming language**. It is used for various purposes such as:

- Web Development
- Data Science
- Machine Learning
- And more!

Explore the versatility and power of Python in your projects.

## Interview Questions

Here are some common interview questions about Python:

1. **What are the key features of Python?**
    - Python is easy to read and write, has a simple syntax, supports multiple programming paradigms, and has a large standard library.

2. **How is memory managed in Python?**
    - Python uses automatic memory management, including garbage collection to reclaim unused memory.

3. **What are Python decorators and how do you use them?**
    - Decorators are a way to modify or enhance functions or methods without changing their code. They are used with the `@decorator_name` syntax.

4. **Explain the difference between lists and tuples in Python.**
    - Lists are mutable, meaning they can be changed after creation, while tuples are immutable and cannot be changed once created.

5. **What is the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python?**
    - The GIL is a mutex that protects access to Python objects, preventing multiple native threads from executing Python bytecodes simultaneously.

6. **How do you handle exceptions in Python?**
    - Exceptions are handled using `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks to catch and manage errors.

7. **What are Python's built-in data types?**
    - Python's built-in data types include integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.

8. **How do you manage packages in Python?**
    - Packages are managed using tools like `pip` for installing and managing Python libraries and dependencies.

9. **What is the difference between Python 2 and Python 3?**
    - Python 3 introduced several changes and improvements over Python 2, including print function syntax, integer division behavior, and Unicode support.

10. **How do you implement inheritance in Python?**
     - Inheritance is implemented by defining a class that inherits from a parent class using the syntax `class ChildClass(ParentClass):`.
